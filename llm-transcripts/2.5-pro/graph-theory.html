            Let's say that the cube graph Q_n has as vertices the set {0,1}^n and two vertices are connected with an edge if and only if their coordinates differ in exactly one position. This is a standard construction. Are you familiar with it?

                    <li><strong>Identify the core concept:</strong> The user is asking about the definition of the cube graph Q_n.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recall/Look up the definition:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertices: The set of all binary strings of length n, denoted {0,1}^n. Each vertex is an n-tuple (x1, x2, ..., xn) where xi ∈ {0,1}.</li>
                            <li>Edges: An edge exists between two vertices, say u = (u1, ..., un) and v = (v1, ..., vn), if and only if they differ in exactly one position. This means the Hamming distance between u and v is exactly 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verify the user's description:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Vertices the set {0,1}^n": Yes, this matches the standard definition.</li>
                            <li>"Two vertices are connected with an edge if and only if their coordinates differ in exactly one position": Yes, this is the standard adjacency rule (Hamming distance 1).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Confirm familiarity:</strong> Based on the verification, the description provided by the user is indeed the standard definition of the n-dimensional hypercube graph Q_n.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formulate the answer:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start with a clear "Yes".</li>
                            <li>Confirm that the description provided is the standard definition.</li>
                            <li>Briefly reiterate the key components (vertices as binary strings/vectors, edges based on Hamming distance 1) to show understanding.</li>
                            <li>Mention common names (n-cube, hypercube graph).</li>
                            <li>Perhaps add a small example (Q2 or Q3) for clarity, though not strictly necessary for just confirming familiarity. (Self-correction: The user just asked if I'm familiar, a simple confirmation is enough, maybe add a sentence elaborating slightly).</li>
                            <li>Final check: Does the answer directly address the user's question? Yes. Is it accurate? Yes. Is it clear? Yes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </details>
            Yes, I am very familiar with this construction.<br><br>
            You have accurately described the <strong>n-dimensional hypercube graph</strong>, often denoted as <strong>Q_n</strong> (or sometimes just the n-cube).<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertices:</strong> The 2^n vertices are indeed represented by all possible binary strings of length n (elements of {0,1}^n).</li>
                <li><strong>Edges:</strong> An edge connects two vertices if and only if the corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one bit position. This is equivalent to saying their Hamming distance is 1.</li>
            </ul><br>
            It's a fundamental structure in graph theory, computer science (especially parallel computing architectures), and other areas.

            Now let's say that the Keane number for a graph G is the largest number k such that: (1) G can be partitioned into k connected subgraphs, and (2) each pair of subgraphs is adjacent, in the sense that for each pair H, K there is an edge of G with one vertex in H and one in K. If you understand so far, tell me the Keane numbers of the cube graphs Q_0, Q_1, and Q_2.

                Here's a thinking process to determine the Keane numbers for Q_0, Q_1, and Q_2:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Understand the Definition of Keane Number:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Goal: Find the largest integer <code>k</code>.</li>
                            <li>Condition 1: The graph <code>G</code> must be partitionable into <code>k</code> <em>connected</em> subgraphs (H_1, H_2, ..., H_k). "Partitionable" means every vertex of <code>G</code> belongs to exactly one subgraph H_i.</li>
                            <li>Condition 2: Every pair of distinct subgraphs (H_i, H_j where i ≠ j) must be <em>adjacent</em>. "Adjacent" means there exists at least one edge in the original graph <code>G</code> connecting a vertex in H_i to a vertex in H_j.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Q_0:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertices: {0,1}^0 = {ε} (the empty string). There's only one vertex. Let's call it <code>v</code>.</li>
                            <li>Edges: There are no edges since there's only one vertex.</li>
                            <li>Partitioning: We need to partition the vertex set {v} into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If k=1, the only partition is { {v} }. The subgraph H_1 = ({v}, {}) is connected (a single vertex is connected).</li>
                                    <li>Condition 2 (adjacency between pairs): Since there's only one subgraph (k=1), this condition is vacuously true (there are no distinct pairs).</li>
                                    <li>Can k be greater than 1? No. If k=2, we would need to partition {v} into two non-empty sets, which is impossible.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Conclusion for Q_0: The only possible value for <code>k</code> is 1. Therefore, the Keane number for Q_0 is 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Analyze Q_1:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertices: {0,1}^1 = {0, 1}. Let's call them v0 and v1.</li>
                            <li>Edges: {(v0, v1)} since the strings '0' and '1' differ in exactly one position.</li>
                            <li>Partitioning: We need to partition {v0, v1} into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Case k=1: The partition is { {v0, v1} }. The subgraph H_1 = ({v0, v1}, {(v0, v1)}) is connected. Condition 2 is vacuously true. So k=1 is possible.</li>
                                    <li>Case k=2: The partition is { {v0}, {v1} }. Let H_1 = ({v0}, {}) and H_2 = ({v1}, {}).
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Condition 1 (Connectivity): Both H_1 and H_2 are connected (single vertices). This holds.</li>
                                            <li>Condition 2 (Adjacency): We need to check if H_1 and H_2 are adjacent. Is there an edge between H_1 and H_2 in Q_1? Yes, the edge (v0, v1) connects a vertex in H_1 to a vertex in H_2. This holds.</li>
                                            <li>So k=2 is possible.</li>

                                    </li>
                                    <li>Case k=3 (or higher): Can we partition {v0, v1} into 3 non-empty sets? No.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Conclusion for Q_1: The possible values for <code>k</code> are 1 and 2. The largest value is 2. Therefore, the Keane number for Q_1 is 2.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Vertices: {0,1}^2 = {00, 01, 10, 11}. Let's call them v00, v01, v10, v11.</li>
                            <li>Edges: {(v00, v01), (v00, v10), (v01, v11), (v10, v11)}. This is a cycle of length 4.</li>
                            <li>Partitioning: We need to partition {v00, v01, v10, v11} into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs such that all pairs are adjacent.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Case k=1: The partition is { {v00, v01, v10, v11} }. The subgraph is Q_2 itself, which is connected. Condition 2 is vacuously true. k=1 is possible.</li>
                                    <li>Case k=2: Can we partition into two connected subgraphs H_1, H_2 such that they are adjacent?

                                                    <li>Adjacency: Is there an edge between H_1 and H_2? Yes, (v00, v10) and (v01, v11) are such edges. Yes.</li>
                                                    <li>So k=2 is possible.</li>

                                                    <li>So k=2 is possible with different partitions.</li>

            Okay, I understand the definition of the Keane number for a graph G. Let <code>k</code> be the Keane number.<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Partition:</strong> The vertex set V(G) is partitioned into <code>k</code> non-empty sets V_1, V_2, ..., V_k.</li>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Each induced subgraph G[V_i] (the subgraph formed by the vertices in V_i and the edges of G between them) must be connected.</li>
                <li><strong>Pairwise Adjacency:</strong> For every pair of distinct indices <code>i, j</code> (where <code>1 <= i < j <= k</code>), there must exist an edge in G connecting a vertex in V_i to a vertex in V_j.</li>
            </ol><br>
            Let's find the Keane numbers for Q_0, Q_1, and Q_2.<br><br>
            <strong>Q_0:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertices: {ε} (the empty string, representing a single vertex). Let's call it <code>v</code>.</li>
                <li>Edges: None.</li>
                <li>Partitioning: We need to partition {v} into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If k=1, the partition is {{v}}. The subgraph induced by {v} is just the vertex itself, which is connected. Condition (2) for adjacency is vacuously true since there are no pairs of subgraphs. So, k=1 is possible.</li>
                        <li>If k > 1, we cannot partition a single vertex into more than one non-empty set.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Therefore, the largest possible value for k is 1.</li>

                <li>Partitioning: We need to partition {v0, v1} into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs such that all pairs are adjacent.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If k=1, the partition is {{v0, v1}}. The induced subgraph is Q_1 itself, which is connected. Adjacency is vacuously true. k=1 is possible.</li>
                        <li>If k=2, the partition is {{v0}, {v1}}. Let H1 = {v0} and H2 = {v1}.

                                <li>Connectivity: G[{v0}] and G[{v1}] are single vertices, hence connected. Yes.</li>
                                <li>Adjacency: Is there an edge between H1 and H2? Yes, the edge (v0, v1) connects them. Yes.</li>
                                <li>So, k=2 is possible.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The largest possible value for k is 2.</li>
                <li><strong>Keane number for Q_1 is 2.</strong></li>

                Here's a thinking process to determine the Keane number for Q_3:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Understand the Goal:</strong> Find the largest <code>k</code> such that Q_3 can be partitioned into <code>k</code> connected subgraphs, where every pair of subgraphs is adjacent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Define Q_3:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vertices: {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111}. (8 vertices)</li>
                            <li>Edges: Connect vertices that differ in exactly one bit. (12 edges)</li>
                            <li>Q_3 is 3-regular and bipartite. V_even = {000, 011, 101, 110}, V_odd = {001, 010, 100, 111}.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Test Potential Values of <code>k</code> (starting from max):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>k=8: Fails adjacency (e.g., {000} vs {111}).</li>
                            <li>k=7: Requires partitioning 8 vertices into 7 sets (one size 2, rest size 1). Let partition be {{u,v}, {w1..w5}}. Requires {w1..w5} to be K5. Q_3 has no K5. Impossible.</li>
                            <li>k=6: Requires K4 or K3 induced by singletons. Q_3 has no K4 or K3. Impossible.</li>
                            <li>k=5: Requires K3 or K2 induced by singletons. K3 impossible. Case (2,2,2,1,1) requires K2 (edge) between singletons. Let H4={v4}, H5={v5}. Must have edge (v4,v5). WLOG v4 even, v5 odd. H1, H2, H3 must span bipartition. Let H_i={u_i, w_i}. Need N(v4)={w1,w2,w3} and N(v5)={u1,u2,u3}. Since (v4,v5) is an edge, v5 must be one of w's, and v4 must be one of u's. WLOG v5=w1, v4=u1. Then H1={u1,w1}={v4,v5}. But H4={v4}, H5={v5} are also in partition. Contradicts disjointness. k=5 impossible.</li>
                            <li>k=4: Can we find a partition? Try (1, 3, 2, 2). Let H1={000}. Neighbors are 001, 010, 100. Put one neighbor in each of H2, H3, H4.

                                    <li>Connectivity: H1 ok. H2 has edge (001,011). H3 has edge (010,110). H4 has path 100-101-111. All connected.</li>

            </details>
            Okay, let's analyze Q_3.<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vertices:</strong> {000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111} (8 vertices).</li>
                <li><strong>Edges:</strong> Connect vertices differing in exactly one position. Q_3 has 12 edges and is 3-regular.</li>
                <li><strong>Bipartition:</strong> Q_3 is bipartite. Let V_even be vertices with an even number of 1s ({000, 011, 101, 110}) and V_odd be vertices with an odd number of 1s ({001, 010, 100, 111}). Edges only exist between V_even and V_odd.</li>
            </ul><br>
            We are looking for the largest <code>k</code> such that V(Q_3) can be partitioned into V_1, ..., V_k where each G[V_i] is connected, and for all i ≠ j, there's an edge between V_i and V_j.<br><br>
            <strong>Maximum Possible k:</strong> The maximum is the number of vertices, 8.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>k=8:</strong> Partition {{v} | v ∈ V(Q_3)}. Connectivity holds. Adjacency fails (e.g., {000} and {111} are not adjacent). <strong>k=8 is impossible.</strong></li>
            </ul><br>
            <strong>Bipartite Constraint:</strong> If k > 2, we cannot have two distinct subgraphs H_i, H_j both entirely contained within V_even, nor can we have two distinct subgraphs both entirely contained within V_odd. This implies at least k-2 subgraphs must contain vertices from both V_even and V_odd.<br><br>
            <strong>k=7, 6, 5:</strong> These would require multiple singleton subgraphs {v_i}. For any two such singletons {v_i}, {v_j} to be adjacent, v_i and v_j must be adjacent in Q_3.
            <ul>
                <li>If k=5, possible size partitions are (4,1,1,1,1), (3,2,1,1,1), (2,2,2,1,1).
                    <ul>
                        <li>(4,1,1,1,1): The 4 singletons must form a K_4. Q_3 does not contain K_4. Impossible.</li>
                        <li>(3,2,1,1,1): The 3 singletons must form a K_3 (triangle). Q_3 is bipartite and contains no K_3. Impossible.</li>
                        <li>(2,2,2,1,1): The 2 singletons {v_i}, {v_j} must be adjacent. As shown in the detailed thought process (and proven separately below), this case leads to a contradiction regarding the disjointness of the partition sets. Therefore, <strong>k=5 is impossible.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Since k=5 is impossible, k=7 and k=6 are also impossible.</li>
            </ul><br>
            <strong>k=4:</strong> Can we partition the 8 vertices into 4 connected, pairwise adjacent subgraphs?
            <ul>
                <li>Consider the following partition:

                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>(H1, H2): {000} vs {001, 011}. Edge (000, 001). Yes.</li>

                <li>All conditions are satisfied. <strong>k=4 is possible.</strong></li>

            Okay, here is a formal proof that the Keane number of Q_3 cannot be 5.<br><br>
            <strong>Proof:</strong><br><br>
            Let G = Q_3. The vertices V(G) are the 8 binary strings of length 3. Q_3 is a 3-regular bipartite graph. Let V(G) = V_even ∪ V_odd be the bipartition, where V_even contains vertices with an even number of 1s ({000, 011, 101, 110}) and V_odd contains vertices with an odd number of 1s ({001, 010, 100, 111}). Both |V_even| = 4 and |V_odd| = 4. All edges in Q_3 connect a vertex in V_even to a vertex in V_odd. Q_3 contains no odd cycles, in particular, no triangles (K_3).<br><br>
            Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the Keane number of Q_3 is k=5. This means there exists a partition of V(G) into 5 non-empty, disjoint sets V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4, V_5 such that:<br>
            1. Each induced subgraph G[V_i] is connected.<br>
            2. For every pair of distinct indices i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, there exists an edge (u, v) in G with u ∈ V_i and v ∈ V_j.<br><br>
            Let H_i = G[V_i].<br><br>
            <strong>Consequence of Bipartite Property:</strong><br>
            Since all edges in Q_3 go between V_even and V_odd, if two distinct subgraphs H_i and H_j were both entirely contained within V_even (or both entirely within V_odd), there could be no edge between them, violating condition (2). Therefore, among the 5 subgraphs H_1, ..., H_5:
            <ul>
                <li>At most one subgraph can have all its vertices in V_even.</li>
                <li>At most one subgraph can have all its vertices in V_odd.</li>
            </ul>
            This implies that at least 5 - 2 = 3 subgraphs must contain vertices from both V_even and V_odd. A connected subgraph containing vertices from both V_even and V_odd must contain at least one edge.<br><br>
            <strong>Analysis based on Singleton Subgraphs:</strong><br>
            A subgraph H_i = G[{v}] consisting of a single vertex {v} is trivially connected. Let <code>s</code> be the number of singleton subgraphs in the partition {H_1, ..., H_5}. The sizes of the sets |V_i| must sum to |V(Q_3)| = 8. The possible size partitions of 8 into 5 parts are:
            <ul>
                <li>(4, 1, 1, 1, 1) -> s = 4</li>
                <li>(3, 2, 1, 1, 1) -> s = 3</li>
                <li>(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) -> s = 2</li>
            </ul><br>
            <strong>Case 1: s ≥ 3</strong><br>
            This covers partitions of type (4,1,1,1,1) and (3,2,1,1,1). Let H_1 = {v1}, H_2 = {v2}, H_3 = {v3} be three distinct singleton subgraphs in the partition. By condition (2), every pair of these subgraphs must be adjacent. This means:
            <ul>
                <li>There must be an edge between H_1 and H_2, which implies (v1, v2) is an edge in Q_3.</li>
                <li>There must be an edge between H_1 and H_3, which implies (v1, v3) is an edge in Q_3.</li>
                <li>There must be an edge between H_2 and H_3, which implies (v2, v3) is an edge in Q_3.</li>
            </ul>
            These three edges form a triangle (K_3) with vertices {v1, v2, v3}. However, Q_3 is bipartite and contains no triangles. This is a contradiction. Therefore, partitions with s ≥ 3 are impossible.<br><br>
            <strong>Case 2: s = 2</strong><br>
            This covers the partition of type (2, 2, 2, 1, 1). Let the partition be H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4, H_5, where |V_1|=|V_2|=|V_3|=2, and H_4={v4}, H_5={v5}.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> H_1, H_2, H_3 must be connected. Since they each have 2 vertices, this means that if V_i = {x, y}, then (x, y) must be an edge in Q_3. H_4 and H_5 are trivially connected.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjacency:</strong> Every pair must be adjacent. In particular, H_4={v4} must be adjacent to H_5={v5}. This requires the edge (v4, v5) to exist in Q_3.</li>
                <li><strong>Bipartite Implications:</strong> Since (v4, v5) is an edge, one vertex must be in V_even and the other in V_odd. Without loss of generality, assume v4 ∈ V_even and v5 ∈ V_odd.
                    <ul>
                        <li>H_4 = {v4} is entirely contained in V_even.</li>
                        <li>H_5 = {v5} is entirely contained in V_odd.</li>
                        <li>From the earlier consequence of bipartiteness, the remaining subgraphs H_1, H_2, H_3 must each contain vertices from both V_even and V_odd.</li>
                        <li>Let V_1 = {u1, w1}, V_2 = {u2, w2}, V_3 = {u3, w3}. Since each must span the bipartition and be connected by an edge, we must have, for each i ∈ {1,2,3}, one vertex in V_even and one in V_odd. WLOG, assume u1, u2, u3 ∈ V_even and w1, w2, w3 ∈ V_odd. The edges (u1, w1), (u2, w2), (u3, w3) must exist in Q_3.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Adjacency with Singletons:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consider H_1={u1, w1} and H_4={v4}. Adjacency requires an edge between them. Since v4 ∈ V_even and u1 ∈ V_even, w1 ∈ V_odd, the edge must be (v4, w1).</li>
                        <li>Consider H_2={u2, w2} and H_4={v4}. The edge must be (v4, w2).</li>
                        <li>Consider H_3={u3, w3} and H_4={v4}. The edge must be (v4, w3).</li>
                        <li>This implies N(v4) = {w1, w2, w3}. Since Q_3 is 3-regular, these are the only neighbors of v4.</li>
                        <li>Consider H_1={u1, w1} and H_5={v5}. Adjacency requires an edge between them. Since v5 ∈ V_odd and u1 ∈ V_even, w1 ∈ V_odd, the edge must be (u1, v5).</li>
                        <li>Consider H_2={u2, w2} and H_5={v5}. The edge must be (u2, v5).</li>
                        <li>Consider H_3={u3, w3} and H_5={v5}. The edge must be (u3, v5).</li>
                        <li>This implies N(v5) = {u1, u2, u3}. Since Q_3 is 3-regular, these are the only neighbors of v5.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The Contradiction:</strong> We have established that N(v4) = {w1, w2, w3} and N(v5) = {u1, u2, u3}. We also know that (v4, v5) is an edge.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since (v4, v5) is an edge, v5 must be a neighbor of v4. Therefore, v5 ∈ N(v4) = {w1, w2, w3}. This implies v5 must be one of the odd vertices w1, w2, or w3.</li>

            <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
            Both possible cases based on the number of singleton sets (s ≥ 3 and s = 2) lead to contradictions. Therefore, the initial assumption that the Keane number of Q_3 is 5 must be false. Since k=4 is possible (as shown previously) and k=5 is impossible, the Keane number for Q_3 is 4.

                    The user wants a concise proof that the Keane number of Q_3 is not 5. I need to extract the core arguments from the previous detailed proof and present them briefly.

                    **Key Arguments:**
                    1.  **Bipartite Property:** Q_3 is bipartite (V_even, V_odd). Any two subgraphs H_i, H_j in the partition must be adjacent. This implies at most one H_i can be fully in V_even and at most one H_j can be fully in V_odd.
                    2.  **No K_3:** Q_3 has no triangles (K_3).
                    3.  **Partition Sizes:** A partition of 8 vertices into 5 parts must have singleton sets {v}. Let 's' be the number of singletons. Possible values for s are 2, 3, or 4.
                    4.  **Case s >= 3:** If s >= 3, let {v1}, {v2}, {v3} be singleton sets. Pairwise adjacency implies (v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v3) are edges, forming a K_3. This contradicts Q_3 having no K_3.
                    5.  **Case s = 2:** Let the partition be H1, H2, H3, {v4}, {v5}.
                        *   Adjacency requires (v4, v5) to be an edge. WLOG, v4 ∈ V_even, v5 ∈ V_odd.
                        *   By the bipartite property (point 1), H1, H2, H3 must each span the bipartition (contain vertices from both V_even and V_odd). Since they must be connected, they must contain edges. The only partition type is (2,2,2,1,1). So |V1|=|V2|=|V3|=2.
                        *   Let Vi = {ui, wi} where ui ∈ V_even, wi ∈ V_odd for i=1,2,3. (ui, wi) must be an edge.
                        *   Adjacency requires (v4, wi) and (ui, v5) for all i=1,2,3.
                        *   This means N(v4) = {w1, w2, w3} and N(v5) = {u1, u2, u3}.
                        *   Since (v4, v5) is an edge, v5 must be in N(v4), so v5 ∈ {w1, w2, w3}. WLOG, let v5 = w1.
                        *   Similarly, v4 must be in N(v5), so v4 ∈ {u1, u2, u3}. WLOG, let v4 = u1.
                        *   Then H1 = {u1, w1} = {v4, v5}. But the partition also contains {v4} and {v5} as distinct sets. This contradicts the requirement that the sets in the partition are disjoint.

                    **Concise Structure:**
                    *   State properties of Q_3 (bipartite, no K_3).
                    *   Assume k=5 partition exists.
                    *   Let 's' be the number of singleton sets in the partition. Possible values for s are 2, 3, 4.
                    *   Rule out s>=3 using the no-K_3 property.
                    *   Rule out s=2 using the bipartite property and adjacency, leading to a contradiction about disjoint sets.
                    *   Conclude k=5 is impossible.

            <strong>Concise Proof that Keane Number of Q_3 is not 5:</strong><br><br>
            Let K(G) be the Keane number of graph G. Assume K(Q_3) = 5 for contradiction. A K(Q_3)=5 partition requires partitioning Q_3's 8 vertices into 5 non-empty, connected, pairwise adjacent subgraphs H_1..H_5. Q_3 is bipartite (V_even/V_odd) and has no K_3.<br><br>
            1.  A partition of 8 into 5 parts must contain `s` singleton sets, where s=2, 3, or 4.<br>
            2.  If s ≥ 3, let {v1}, {v2}, {v3} be singletons. Pairwise adjacency forces edges (v1,v2), (v1,v3), (v2,v3), forming a K_3 in Q_3. Contradiction.<br>
            3.  Thus s=2. The partition must have sizes (2,2,2,1,1). Let H4={v4}, H5={v5}.<br>
            4.  Adjacency requires edge (v4,v5). WLOG, v4 ∈ V_even, v5 ∈ V_odd.<br>
            5.  Since Q_3 is bipartite, at most one H_i can be fully in V_even (H4) and at most one fully in V_odd (H5). Thus H1, H2, H3 must span the bipartition. As |V_i|=2, let V_i={ui, wi} (ui even, wi odd) for i=1,2,3. Edge (ui,wi) exists.<br>
            6.  Adjacency of H4 to H1,H2,H3 requires edges (v4,w1), (v4,w2), (v4,w3). So N(v4)={w1,w2,w3}.<br>
            7.  Adjacency of H5 to H1,H2,H3 requires edges (u1,v5), (u2,v5), (u3,v5). So N(v5)={u1,u2,u3}.<br>
            8.  Since (v4,v5) is an edge, v5∈N(v4) ⇒ v5=wi for some i (WLOG v5=w1). Also v4∈N(v5) ⇒ v4=uj for some j (WLOG v4=u1).<br>
            9.  Then V1 = {u1, w1} = {v4, v5}. But V4={v4} and V5={v5} are also sets in the partition. This violates disjointness (V1∩V4≠∅). Contradiction.<br><br>
            Both possible cases lead to contradictions, so K(Q_3) ≠ 5.
